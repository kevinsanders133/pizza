            HI! PIZZA SHOP INVITES YOU TO THE WARSAW POWIÅšLE. LONG LIVE PIZZA!

            <p>
            HI! PIZZA SHOP is a place with traditional pizza, prepared by our Italian pizzaiolo according to a traditional recipe. Only high-quality Italian products are used on our pizza. In the season that is appropriate for this season, we serve a special menu - in it you can find interesting pizzas with, for example, asparagus or chanterelles. The dough from which the pizzas are made matures for 72 hours, and is baked in a special oven at 450 degrees! We also invite you to our pastas, antipasti, salads, desserts and to our Ave Bar. Our pizzeria was recognized as one of the top 50 in Europe in the "Top 50 pizza" list for 2019 and 2020. This ranking is a list of the best pizzerias on all continents . The curators of the list are Barbara Guerra (creator of the Le Strade della Mozzarella congress), well-known sommelier Albert Sapere and Luciano Pignataro, gastronomy specialist on the website "Il Mattino" and creator of a widely read blog about food and wine.
